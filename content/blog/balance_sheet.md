# Balance sheet

## TL;DR
- Shows what the company owns (asset) and what it ows (liability)
- Difference between assets and liabilities is equity
- Assets must always balance with liabilities

## What is a balance sheet?
Balance sheet is sometimes referred to as the statement of financial position. It lists the assets and liabilities that a company has. The difference between assets and liabilities is the shareholder's equity. Equity represetns the value of the money that shareholders have invested in the firm. 

If the liability increases, for example, by issuing bonds, the asset must also increase. If a firm generates huge profits that drive an increase in assets, equity also increases. 

## Items that make up the balance sheet
### Asset accounts: current assets
Current assets are those that can be used up or be converted to cash within one business cycle (usually means 1 year). 

Current assets can include cash and equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and inventories. 

### Asset accounts: noncurrent assetts
Non-current assets are property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), investments and intangible assets


### Liability accounts: current liabilities
Current liabilities are money that the company expects to pay out within one year. Pay attention to the accounts payable and short-term borrowings or payables. 

Short-term borrowings refer to money that the company has borrowed for a term of less than a year, usually to meet short-term needs. It's often a line of bank credit that the firm has temporarily drawn down, though it might also be a portion of long-term debt that's due within the next year. 

This line item becomes especially important for companies in financial distresses because the entire amount often has to be paid back quickly. Compare the short-term debt to the company's assets. 

### Liability accounts: noncurrent liabilities


### Stockholder's equity
Pay attention to the retained earnings which records the amount of capital a company has generated over its lifetime - minus dividends and stock buybacks, which represent funds that have already been returned to shareholders.
